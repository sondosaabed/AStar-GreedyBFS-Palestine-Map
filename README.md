# Palestinian map using Java, JavaFX Astar (A*) and Greedy Best First Serach (GBFS)
## Summary
Throughout the development of this project, the process was divided into 3 sections: 
- The first section (Data Collection) collects data including Cities, roads,
and air distance comma-separated Values (CSV) files.
- The second section (Methodology) is concerned with the selected algorithms, their implementation, and the justification of that selection.
- The third section (User Interface) presents the user interface specifications.

## Features:
- User can browse for the cities, streets and arial data.
- User can chose distination and sourse cities.
- User can find the shhortest path between them.
- User can see the distance and the path on the map.
- User can chose the algorithm used (A*) or (Gdeedy BFS).

After chosing the algorithm and the source and the destination the rout is shown in the Map:
